**Note:**
The logic that has been followed while writing these sample programs is not 100% perfect.
I'm sure I might have missed some edge cases for almost all of the sample programs and goal is just to give you brief idea and once
you understand the concepts, I'm pretty sure you can improve it.

**Note:**
Most of the programs have been taken from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ and appropriate links have also been provided.
